Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning. The dataset contains information about the passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether or not they survived.

Data Source
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster.

Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn

Steps Involved
1. Data Exploration:
Explores the dataset to understand the features and characteristics of the data.

2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Cleans and prepares the data for machine learning by filling in missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features.

3. Feature Selection:
Selects the most relevant features for predicting survival using statistical analysis and data visualization.

4. Model Building:
Builds several machine learning models using scikit-learn, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine.

5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluates the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tunes the parameters of the best performing model using grid search to improve its performance.

7. Prediction:
Uses the final model to predict the survival of passengers in the test dataset.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can learn how to clean and prepare data for machine learning, select relevant features, build and evaluate machine learning models, and make predictions on new data. The Jupyter Notebook on GitHub allows anyone to reproduce the results and further explore the dataset.
